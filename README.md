# InventoryManagementSystem
Java project that allows you to create, modify and delete parts and products from inventory.
This was created in Java while working on my CS degree. Parts can be associated to prouducts.
Each part and product have an ID, Name, Min Stock, Max Stock, Price, Inventory.
Products also have associated parts.
Parts have two classes, In-House and Outsourced
